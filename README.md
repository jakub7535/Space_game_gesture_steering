Star Wars is game implemented in **PYTHON** using **Pygame** library. 
Our goal is to collect as many points as we can, you collect them by catching gems. You also have to look for asteroids, you can simply run from them or shoot them with laser. With more points, objects are apearing more frequently and with higher velocity.
